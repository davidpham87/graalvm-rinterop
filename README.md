# R_interop

A simple example to help the interaction with R and Clojure in GraalVM

## Usage

Install GraalVM first. See this
[guide](https://gist.github.com/ricardozanini/fa65e485251913e1467837b1c5a8ed28)
for a how to. Note that `alternatives` is actually `update-alternatives` on
most linux distribution.

### Install FastR

If you created the symbolic link `/usr/lib/jvm/graalvm` to target the content
of the graalvm tar file, then

``` shell
sudo /usr/lib/jvm/graalvm/bin/gu install R
```

A local `~/R` directory should be created to install packages and I would
strongly recommend to create an alias under `~/bin`to `FastR` in order to not
messup with your usual `R`.

``` shell
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/graalvm/bin/R ~/bin/FastR
```

# Clojure

On the Clojure part:

``` clojure
;; inside core.clj

;; define the rnorm function in clojure linked to the R rnorm function
(defn-r rnorm)

;; positional call to the rnorm function (n=10, mean=2, sd=3)
(rnorm 10 2 3)

;; Same as above for the qnorm, but accepts a maps of arguments
(defn-r-kw qnorm)
;; usual 0.95 and 0.975 quantile
(qnorm {:p [0.95, 0.975]})

;; Same as above with standard deviation of 2,
;; observe we did not specify (which then takes the default value 0)
(qnorm {:p [0.95, 0.975] :sd 2})
```

## Caveat

- Matrix dimensions are sometimes not respected (see the `lm`) example.
- Classes are not kept after conversion. [big issue, write R snippets to keep
  the class of the object, killing the whole python interop].
- Clojure rational numbers (e.g 3/2) should be avoided as they are not properly
  converted into R representation.
