# R_interop

A simple example to help the interaction with R and Clojure in GraalVM

# Status

Clearly alpha. The goal is to keep the function call mechanism but creating a
better interop story with R objects (`lm` or `ggplot`). That being said, the
bindings to R should work and  stay stable.

## Usage

Install GraalVM first. See this
[guide](https://gist.github.com/ricardozanini/fa65e485251913e1467837b1c5a8ed28)
for a how to. Note that `alternatives` is actually `update-alternatives` on
most linux distribution.

### Install FastR

If you created the symbolic link `/usr/lib/jvm/graalvm` to target the content
of the graalvm tar file, then

``` shell
sudo /usr/lib/jvm/graalvm/bin/gu install R
```

A local `~/R` directory should be created to install packages and I would
strongly recommend to create an alias under `~/bin`to `FastR` in order to not
messup with your usual `R`.

``` shell
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/graalvm/bin/R ~/bin/FastR
```

# Clojure

On the Clojure part:

``` clojure
;; inside core.clj

(require '[r-interop.core :as rc])

;; define the rnorm function in clojure linked to the R rnorm function
(rc/defn-r rnorm)

;; positional call to the rnorm function (n=10, mean=2, sd=3)
(rnorm 10 2 3)

;; Same as above for the qnorm, but accepts a maps of arguments
(rc/defn-r qnorm)
;; usual 0.95 and 0.975 quantile
(qnorm :** {:p [0.95, 0.975]})

;; Same as above with standard deviation of 2,
;; observe we did not specify (which then takes the default value 0)
(qnorm :** {:p [0.95, 0.975] :sd 2})

;; you don't need to define all the R function like that
;; I created these packages and it easy to create your own with rc/create-package-bindings

(require '[r-interop.packages.base :as r-base])
(require '[r-interop.packages.stats :as st])
(rc/argslists st/qnorm)

```

## Naming in r_interop.packages.*

All R word split `like.this`, `snake_case`, `camelCase`, `PascalCase` are
converted to lisp `kebab-case`. The conversion is automatic, but some control
is performed to not split terms that belong together (e.g. `SVD`).

Moreover, all conversion function including a `2` are replaced with `->`
(e.g. `cov2cor` is converted to `cov->cor`).

## Caveat

- Matrix dimensions are sometimes not respected (see the `lm`) example.
- Classes are not kept after conversion. [big issue, write R snippets to keep
  the class of the object, killing the whole python interop].
- Clojure rational numbers (e.g 3/2) should be avoided as they are not properly
  converted into R representation.
